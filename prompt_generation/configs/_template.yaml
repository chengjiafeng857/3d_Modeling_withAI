# Copy this file to create a new character spec:
#   cp configs/_template.yaml configs/my_character.yaml
#
# Then run:
#   uv run generate_prompts.py -i configs/my_character.yaml -o prompts -v v1

# ============================================================================
# TIPS FOR GOOD CHARACTER SPECS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. BE SPECIFIC: "tall android with trench coat" > "robot character"
#
# 2. THINK 3D: Will this design work when converted to 3D?
#    - Avoid overly complex details that won't translate
#    - Consider how clothing/armor will deform during animation
#
# 3. COLOR WISELY: 2-4 colors usually work best
#    - Too many colors look chaotic
#    - Include one "accent" color for visual interest
#
# 4. PROPS MATTER: Items define character identity
#    - A mage without a staff looks like anyone
#    - Props should be clearly visible, not hidden
#
# 5. SILHOUETTE TEST: Would you recognize this character as a shadow?
#    - Distinctive shapes help recognition
#    - Avoid generic "human standing" shapes
